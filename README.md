Online shopping is something most retailers have adopted, but users
are slowly migrating from websites to mobile apps. That's why e-
commerce has set a strong focus on responsive websites, which can
be seamlessly accessed from a desktop computer or a mobile
browser. Along with that, users also demand higher standards of
quality which cannot always be met by even the most responsive
websites. Loading times, laggy animations, non-native components,
or a lack of native features may hurt user experiences resulting in
low conversion rates.
Building our e-commerce app in React Native can reduce the
development efforts required due to the possibility of reusing some
web components, which were already designed for the web (using
React.js). Besides that, we can reduce the time to market and
development costs, making React Native a very attractive tool for
small and medium-sized businesses willing to sell their products or
services online
